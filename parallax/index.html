            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Google Fonts makes it easy to bring personality and performance to your websites and products. Our robust
                catalog of open-source fonts and icons, makes it easy to integrate expressive type and icons
                seamlessly—no matter where you are in the world.
                <br> <br>

                Discover great typography and iconography
                Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and test fonts for
                use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
                information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics on usage and

                <br> <br>demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you discover new fonts that have been
                vetted and organized by our team of designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort
                organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can also create your own
                highly customized collections by filtering families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and
                review sample copy. Collections can be shared,
                <br> <br>making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and streamlined
                throughout the design and engineering process. In 2021, we’ll begin adding icons to our Google Fonts
                catalog, expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set will be the Material
                icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common communication needs. Download them on desktop
                to use them in your digital products for Android, iOS, and web.
                <br> <br>
                Collaborate with open source
                All the fonts and icons in our catalog are free and open source, making beautiful typography and
                iconography accessible to anyone for any project. This means you can share favorites and collaborate
                easily with friends and colleagues. Google Fonts takes care of all the licensing and hosting, ensuring
                that the latest and greatest version of any font is available to everyone.
                <br> <br> <br>
                Make the web faster
                Using the code generated by Google Fonts, our servers will automatically send the smallest possible file
                to every user based on the technologies that their browser supports. For example, we use WOFF 2.0
                compression when available. This makes the web faster for all users—particularly in areas where
                bandwidth and connectivity are an issue. Now everyone can enjoy the same quality and design integrity in
                their products and web pages, no matter where they are in the world.
                <br> <br> <br>
                The icon sets that are delivered by Google Fonts benefit from the same infrastructure.
