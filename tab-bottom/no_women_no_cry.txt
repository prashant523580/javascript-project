Said I remember when we used to sit</br>
C   G   Am  Am2         F <br>
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, ob-serving the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

No woman, no cry</br>

Oh my Little sister, don't she'd no tears </br>
